-
-The code is structured into these files:
-
-  virt_top_utils.mli / virt_top_utils.ml
-
-    String functions and other small utility functions.  This is
-    included directly into virt_top.ml.
-
-  virt_top_version.ml
-
-    The version number (automatically generated by configure).
-
-  virt_top.mli / virt_top.ml
-
-    This is the virt-top program.
-
-    The two interesting functions are called 'collect' and 'redraw'.
-
-    'collect' collects all the information about domains, etc.
-
-    'redraw' updates the display on each frame.
-
-    Another interesting function is 'start_up' which handles all
-    start-up stuff, eg. command line arguments, connecting to the
-    hypervisor, enabling curses.
-
-    The function 'main_loop' runs the main loop and has sub-functions
-    to deal with keypresses, help screens and so on.
-
-  virt_top_xml.ml
-
-    Any code which needs the optional xml-light library goes
-    in here.  Mainly for parsing domain XML descriptions to get
-    the list of block devices and network interfaces.
-
-    The reason for having it in a separate file is so that we
-    don't depend on xml-light.
-
-  virt_top_csv.ml
-
-    Any code which needs the optional ocaml-csv library goes
-    in here.  This implements the --csv command line option.
-
-  virt_top_calendar1.ml
-  virt_top_calendar2.ml
-
-    Any code which needs the optional ocaml-calendar library
-    goes in here.  This implements the --end-time command line
-    option.  Note there are two incompatible versions of the
-    ocaml-calendar library, which is why we have two
-    implementations.  The Makefile works out which one to use.
-
-  virt_top_gettext.ml
-
-    Gettext interaction (this is generated by ./configure).
-
-  virt_top_main.ml
-
-    This is just a small bit of code to glue the modules above
-    together.
-
-The man-page is generated from the single file:
-
-  virt-top.pod
-
-which generates (using perldoc) the following:
-
-  virt-top.1
-  virt-top.txt
